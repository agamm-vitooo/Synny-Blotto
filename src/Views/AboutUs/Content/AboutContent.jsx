        Greek Yogurt is healthier than regular yogurt. <br />
        It's made with live active cultures and is an excellent source of calcium for healthy bones. <br />  
        <br />
        It's high in protein and low in sugar, which makes it perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! <br />
        Greek yogurt is made by straining out the whey from regular yogurt. This results in a thicker, creamier product that's higher in protein and lower in sugar than regular yogurt. <br />
        Greek yogurt is also much more versatile than regular yogurt. It can be used in a variety of recipes, from breakfast dishes to desserts. <br />
